Beware!!!
Please read the document before running any of the notebooks.
Running the notebook before reading this document will cause to lose all valuable outputs.
Here is the link of my article on Medium.

For the Regression notebook, there are no major concerns.
Just make sure that the csv file is within the same folder as the notebook.
Also note that running the Relplot code, where we graphs the numerical values vs datetime.
It will take some time to execute the graphs.



For the NLP notebook, I removed my personal API key.
With a string of XXXXXX.
This is so that the reader can input their own private API key.
Once they do, they could full run the code.
You will also need to run the notebook on Google Collab.



For the CNN notebook, you will need to run it on Google Collab.
Also uploading the image dataset on your google drive.
Depending on how you upload it, you will need to update the path on the notebook.
To obtain the image dataset, here is the site I used.
I took the first 201 images (so from 0 to 200).

Please be aware that running this notebook is very consumming on time and your computer.
I was able to focus a vast majority on my PC to run this notebook at a very fast speed.
So please consider to do this as well.
